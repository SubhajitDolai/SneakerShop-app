## Dependencies

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - A framework for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) - A wrapper around InheritedWidget to make state management easier.
- [flutter_slidable](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_slidable) - A package for adding swipe-to-dismiss functionality to list items.

## How It Works

The app leverages Flutterâ€™s widget-based architecture to deliver a smooth and responsive experience. The home page displays a curated selection of sneakers, which users can add to their cart. The cart page provides a list of selected items with swipe-to-delete functionality using the `flutter_slidable` package. Navigation is facilitated by a bottom navigation bar and a drawer menu, offering easy access to different sections of the app. The overall design maintains a clean and modern aesthetic to enhance the shopping experience.
